## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Download and Extract

Extract MagicServer to any location, e.g.:

```
D:\MagicServer
```

### 2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator

> Required to allow Apache, MariaDB, and Redis to run properly.

```bat
D:
cd MagicServer
```

### 3. Install MariaDB

Run the following to install MariaDB:

```bat
php\php.exe install-mariadb.php
```

### 4. Install MagicAppBuilder

Run the following to download and install the latest version:

```bat
php\php.exe install-magicappbuilder.php
```

### 5. Start the Server

Starts Apache, MariaDB, Redis, and rebuilds configs:

```bat
php\php.exe start.php
```

### 6. Set the MariaDB Root User Password

Once the server is up and running, it's important to set a secure password for the MariaDB `root` user.

To do this, run the following script:

```bat
php\php.exe set-mariadb-password.php
```

By default, this script will set the `root` user's password to `password`. If you'd prefer to use a different password, you can modify the script beforehand by editing the following lines in the `set-mariadb-password.php` file:

```php
$rootPassword = ''; // Current password. Leave empty if no password is set yet.
$newPassword = 'password'; // Desired new password.
```

If you've already executed the script before changing the password, simply fill in the current password in the `$rootPassword` variable and re-run the script. This ensures the password update is applied correctly.

> Tip: Always choose a strong, unique password for database root access to enhance security and prevent unauthorized access.

### 7. Access Your Application and Tools

Open your browser and go to:

* MagicAppBuilder:

  ```
  http://localhost/MagicAppBuilder/
  ```

* phpMyAdmin (MariaDB web interface):

  ```
  http://localhost/phpmyadmin/
  ```

> If you see the error **"Login without a password is forbidden by configuration"**, set a MariaDB root password by running:
>
> ```bat
> php\php.exe set-mariadb-password.php
> ```

### 8. Stop the Server

To stop all services:

```bat
php\php.exe stop.php
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Template-based configurations are rebuilt automatically.

| Component | Template File                | Generated File      |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Apache    | `config/httpd-template.conf` | `config/httpd.conf` |
| PHP       | `config/php-template.ini`    | `php/php.ini`       |
| MariaDB   | `config/my-template.ini`     | `config/my.ini`     |
| Redis     | `config/redis-template.conf` | `redis/redis.conf`  |

> 📝 Do **not** edit generated files. Modify the templates instead.

## 🛡️ Default Credentials

| Service         | Username        | Password        |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| MariaDB         | `root`          | `password`      |
| MagicAppBuilder | `administrator` | `administrator` |
| Your App        | `superuser`     | `superuser`     |

> 🔐 Secure your environment by setting strong passwords.

### 🔐 Changing the MariaDB Root Password via phpMyAdmin

To change the root password securely using phpMyAdmin:

1. Open [http://localhost/phpmyadmin/](http://localhost/phpmyadmin/) in your browser.
2. Log in with the default credentials:

   * Username: `root`
   * Password: `password`
3. Click the **"User accounts"** tab on the top menu.
4. Find the user **`root`@`localhost`** and click **"Edit privileges"**.
5. Scroll to the **"Change password"** section.
6. Enter your **new secure password** twice, and click **Go**.
7. Repeat the same steps for any other **`root`** user entries with a different Host name.
8. After changing the password, you can log out and log in again using the new credentials.

> ⚠️ If you update the root password, make sure any application (including MagicAppBuilder) that connects to MariaDB is updated accordingly.
