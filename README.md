## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Download and Extract

Extract the MagicServer package to any location, for example:

```
D:\MagicServer
```

### 2. Open Command Prompt as Administrator

Before running any script, **open Command Prompt (CMD) with Administrator privileges**:

1. Click Start Menu → search **"cmd"**
2. Right-click **Command Prompt** → click **"Run as administrator"**
3. In Command Prompt, navigate to the server directory:

```bash
D:
cd MagicServer
```

### 3. Install MagicAppBuilder

To download and install the latest version of MagicAppBuilder into `www/MagicAppBuilder/`, run:

```bash
php\php.exe install.php
```

> ⚠️ This step is required before starting the server.

### 4. Start the Server

Start the Apache and MariaDB servers, and regenerate configuration files by running:

```bash
php\php.exe start.php
```

> ℹ️ `start.php` will always regenerate server configuration files based on the current path using templates.

### 5. Access Your Application

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost/MagicAppBuilder/
```

You should now see the MagicAppBuilder interface.

### 6. Stop the Server

To stop Apache and MariaDB services, run:

```bash
php\php.exe stop.php
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The server uses template-based configuration. These templates are used to generate final configuration files each time the server starts:

* Apache: `config/httpd-template.conf`
* PHP: `php/php-template.ini`
* MariaDB: `mysql/my-template.ini`

> ⚠️ Do **not** manually edit the generated config files. Instead, edit the templates.

## 🛡️ Default Credentials

| Service          | Username        | Password      |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ------------- |
| MariaDB          | root            | (no password) |
| MagicAppBuilder  | administrator   | administrator |
| Your Application | superuser       | superuser     |

> 💡 It is strongly recommended to set a password for the root user after setup.
